## Concept

This lab covers the concepts for Lecture 2 and 3:
  
  * i2c (Inter-Integrated Circuit) / TWI
  * Registers
  * Accelerometer
  * Clock Reference (RTC)
  * ISR Vector
  * Interrupts
  
## Objective
  
  * Read data from the accelerometer
  * Send it to computer over serial
  	* Edit a register in the accelerometer to sense a tap to generate an interrupt
